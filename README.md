# Enterprise AI Solution Architect Copilot

A full-stack **Multi-Agent Generative AI platform** that automates enterprise AI solution design, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assessment, Azure AI architecture planning, security and governance evaluation, cost estimation, and executive reporting.

The platform enables users to describe a business challenge in natural language and automatically generates a structured enterprise AI solution by orchestrating multiple specialized AI agents powered by **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite**.

### Generated Business Analysis

The first AI agent performs a structured business analysis by identifying the business problem, objectives, operational challenges, and expected outcomes before the remaining specialized agents continue the solution generation process.

# Multi-Agent Workflow

The request is processed sequentially through six specialized AI agents:

1. Business Analyst Agent
2. RAG Architect Agent
3. Azure Architect Agent
4. Security Agent
5. Cost Agent
6. Executive Report Agent

Each agent focuses on a specific domain and contributes its expertise to generate a comprehensive enterprise AI solution.
